title = "Enabling Monolingual Translators: Post-Editing vs. Options",
abstract = "We carried out a study on monolingual translators with no knowledge of the source language, but aided by post-editing and the display of translation options. On Arabic-English and Chinese-English, using standard test data and current statistical machine translation systems, 10 monolingual translators were able to translate 35\% of Arabic and 28\% of Chinese sentences correctly on average, with some ofthe participants coming close to professional bilingual performance on some of the documents.",

This chapter also considers some of the ways in which translation technology has influenced the practice and the product of translation, as well as translators’ professional competence and their preferences with regard to tools and resources.}",

abstract = {Agile software development represents a major departure from traditional, plan-based approaches to software engineering. A systematic review of empirical studies of agile software development up to and including 2005 was conducted. The search strategy identified 1996 studies, of which 36 were identified as empirical studies. The studies were grouped into four themes: introduction and adoption, human and social factors, perceptions on agile methods, and comparative studies. The review investigates what is currently known about the benefits and limitations of, and the strength of evidence for, agile methods. Implications for research and practice are presented. The main implication for research is a need for more and better empirical studies of agile software development within a common research agenda. For the industrial readership, the review provides a map of findings, according to topic, that can be compared for relevance to their own settings and situations.}

This article examines publications and citations to illustrate how the research on agile has progressed in the 10 years following the articulation of the manifesto. Specifically, we delineate the conceptual structure underlying agile scholarship by performing an analysis of authors who have made notable contributions to the field. Further, we summarize prior research and introduce contributions in this special issue on agile software development. We conclude by discussing directions for future research and urging agile researchers to embrace a theory-based approach in their scholarship.}
