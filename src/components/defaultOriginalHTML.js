            <h2>Application Aims</h2>
            <p>This application aims to bridge the linguistic divide by making AWS blog content more accessible and inclusive. It does this by translating AWS Blog Posts into low-resource languages effectively using Amazon Translate or a custom in-house model built, trained, and fine-tuned using Amazon SageMaker.</p>
            <h2>How to Use This Application</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Enter the URL of the AWS blog post you want to translate in the URL input field.</li>
                <li>Select the target language for the translation from the language dropdown menu.</li>
                <li>Select the translation model from the model dropdown menu. You have the option to choose between Amazon Translate or a custom in-house model.</li>
                <li>Click the 'Translate!' button to start the translation process. Please wait while the application fetches the original blog post and translates it into the chosen language. This process may take a few seconds.</li>
                <li>Once the translation is complete, the original and translated blog posts will be displayed side by side. You can compare the translation with the original post.</li>
                <li>You can also rate the quality of the translation using the star rating system provided at the top of the translated post.</li>
            </ol>
